";08:51;08:55;""And if you're a dancer", that was big time," right?"""
";08:55;08:59;""So", yeah," it was it was definitely a 2 way street."""
";08:59;09:06;""In that she looked to the students to recommend", you know," what was the pulse of the time."""
";09:06;09:14;""But then because of her correct connections in the music industry"," she was able to pull in some bigger names."""

";09:37;09:38;""Mm hmm."""
";09:38;09:39;""Yeah", I mean," that makes sense."""
";09:39;09:48;""One of the things that", you know, I've been sort of one of my main things that I've been working on this this year or this summer has been sort of compiling like a list of
"concerts at the college."""
";09:48;10:05;""And just one of the things that's always that struck me while I've been doing it is just like it was always a really good mix of both people who", you know, used to
potentially be in their prime, but, you know, are not as famous," but also really up to date artists."""
";10:05;10:12;""And I think that really was only possible", right, if you took input from students as opposed to just saying, no, I'm going to book this band, I'm going to book this band or

";10:13;10:16;""Yeah"," she was definitely collaborative."""

";10:43;10:50;""Yeah"," I feel like so many people that we've talked to just sort of have the same have the same memories right of talking on the phone."""
";10:50;11:04;""And which is", you know, obviously, you know, I think one of the things we've been thinking about is just like, you know, if if if she was working today, obviously, there
would be some sort of accommodation or, you know," working from home or remote or whatnot."""
";11:04;11:19;""But obviously", you know, in the 60s and 70s and 80s, there wasn't that and just so I think it's I think it's really unique to be able to sort of make a connection with

";11:37;11:49;""Could you", uh, I guess guess we'll go, you know, you kind of touched on this, but do you have like a particular concert or particular event that you really, really

";12:16;12:19;""Um"," the small intimate concerts."""
";12:19;12:28;""And I", what I remember was like," we'd get a reggae band from Chicago to come in and they'd be in the north lounge of the forum."""
";12:28;12:39;""Um", and it would literally like being in a nightclub in Chicago, if they would transform it, the lights would go down and you'd be in a red bar, um," in the north."""
";12:39;12:41;""Um"," lounge of the forum."""
";12:41;12:50;""So", I mean, I think every, even though it's cloudy now, cause it's like 40 years ago, I remember everything was memorable," right?"""
";12:50;12:55;""Because you were bringing culture into the middle of Iowa."""
";12:55;13:06;""Um", so every time something happened, you know, Coco Taylor was a huge blues musician back in the day when she came on campus," right?"""

";13:32;13:33;""That was a big thing."""

";30:47;30:50;""And so one of the things that we sort of."""
";30:50;31:02;""Sort of decided was that the main way that we were going to be able to bring sort of collect research on Georgia was to do oral history interviews with the folks that work"
"with her. Right."""
";31:02;31:09;""And so we're going to sort of put a transcript of this on the website we have"," we're creating a website with information."""

";31:17;31:32;""So from when she was", when she was a little kid and athlete to when she worked at the college, we've been able to go to Ackley, the Ackley Historical Society, the Ackley

";31:32;31:44;""And then Jackie note taker here has been doing work on just sort of concerts in the context of the college with other", with other," with other people."""
";31:44;31:47;""And then I've been focusing on", like I said earlier," a timeline."""
";31:47;31:50;""So sort of the goal of this project is", I think," twofold."""
";31:50;31:56;""The first one is to sort of make sure that Georgia", you know," that Georgia gets her flowers right as someone who."""
";31:56;32:08;""As someone who", I mean, I personally come to the conclusion after the past year or so of research that she is a top five most influential person to ever work at the
college," just in terms of cultural impact."""
";32:08;32:18;""When you", when you, you know, when I talk to alums and I, you know, I can from alums of essentially any year from, you know, from 1960 to 2001, I can always say, you know,
"Georgia Dental."""
";32:18;32:21;""And they'll be like", oh," I remember this concert. I remember this concert or whatever."""
";32:21;32:23;""And so it's clearly. So that's sort of one of the parts."""
";32:23;32:36;""And the other part is to sort of catalog the history of Grinnell concerts", because it's such an important part of the college's history that really does not get talked
"about a lot."""
";32:36;32:39;""And so those are sort of the two"," those are sort of the two aspects of it. Right."""
";32:39;32:40;""Okay."""
";32:40;32:50;""And yeah", I mean, we've, I've had a ton of fun creating the website. It's definitely going to take a while. I mean, putting together these oral history interviews,

";32:54;33:13;""Yeah", of course I can definitely do that. Perfect. And just actually one. Can I just ask you one last question? I just thought about it. I was just wondering if you could,
you mentioned sort of the town community. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the college town relations when you were," when you were at the college."""
";33:13;33:23;""Oh", well, there was definitely a divide," right? Between college and townies."""
";33:23;33:47;""Um", it depends. Um, I don't think it was the best. Um, the college definitely overran the town at the time. Right. And the town was still growing. I think, you know, we had
"a dairy queen."""
";33:47;34:02;""And that's about it. I remember taking road trips to Marshall town or going to rag stock in Iowa city. So the town and the college wasn't"," I don't think."""

";34:38;34:44;""Can definitely see that. But", you know, I think I just think that," you know."""
";34:44;34:53;""I don't know having having an institution like having an institution like Grinnell in a city like Grinnell is bound to cause", you know," some sort of."""

";35:02;35:05;""But I know it wasn't greatest."""
";35:05;35:14;""Actually", I feel when I go back now, I feel," I feel like it's better for some reason."""
";35:14;35:22;""And I don't know", maybe I'm just older and, and, and walking slower, but I don't know how it is for the kids now," but."""
