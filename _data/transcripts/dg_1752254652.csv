00:00,,"Perfect. All right, we are recording. Let me just turn off my outlook notifications because"
00:07,,"meaning a lot of them. Perfect. So this this following the following interview was conducted with Althea Ricketts on behalf of the Georgia Dentel summer map for Grinnell concerts, Georgia Dentel and student life in history and memory project. It took place on. Let me just confirm the date July 29th, 2024."
00:27,,"And the interviewer is Hayden Suarez Davis. We already have the legal release, so that's all good. So would you just begin by introducing yourself, your name, your class year and where do you live and what do you do now?"
00:39,,So my name is Althea Ricketts. I'm the class of 1986.
00:47,,I'm the vice president of corporate initiatives at Sure Incorporated.
00:53,,And they're located right outside of Chicago and a suburb called Niles. That's where our corporate offices are.
00:59,,"I'm responsible for things related to sustainability,"
01:04,,"inclusion, diversity, equity and access. And I also manage"
01:09,,a program office where I have a bunch of project managers managing enterprise wide projects.
01:17,,"So, um, I think that's a great question."
01:18,,"Perfect. All right. So, um, at Grinnell, um, you started class of 86. What did you study? And, uh, if you had a favorite class or professor, just something that really sticks out in your mind, could you share that?"
01:30,,"So, um, so my major was sociology."
01:34,,"Um, it was so long ago. I barely remember my teachers, but."
01:42,,But I had 1 teacher by the name of Ilsa lighting her.
01:45,,She was a sociology professor. She was 1 of my favorites.
01:49,,"She was, um."
01:51,,revolutionary for her time and I really looked up to her. She was a badass.
01:56,,Mm hmm.
01:57,,"Nice. Okay. Um, and then, uh, can you describe sort of your main activities at Grinnell College? What were you? What were you? Um, what were you doing extracurricular wise?"
02:08,,"So, um, babe, Bortman."
02:11,,Babe was the head of our dance department at the time. Her husband was also a professor there.
02:18,,"They lived in that Frank Lloyd Wright house that's in Grinnell. If you're not aware, there's a Frank Lloyd Wright house in Grinnell."
02:27,,"Um, she was the head of the dance program and I was part of the dance troupe. I was very involved in dancing."
02:32,,I lived on South campus at the time that was called like the artsy part of campus.
02:38,,South was artsy North was more athletic because North was closer to the PC and South was closest to the theater.
02:47,,So my extracurricular activity was centered around the arts.
02:52,,"Uh, music, dance, theater."
02:56,,"Um, perfect. And you were, uh, and you were a concerts, you were concerts chair, right? Can you just remind me what?"
03:03,,Yes.
03:04,,"You know, I want to say it was like maybe 84 85 86."
03:10,,"Um, I want to say I didn't do it for my last year, but I might have."
03:18,,"It's very cloudy, but it was at least two years between."
03:22,,84 and 86.
03:25,,"Perfect. I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know. It all goes by so fast, right? It's kind of hard to."
03:29,,"Yeah. And so just how would you describe sort of the general atmosphere, um, student culture wise at, uh, during your time at Grinnell?"
03:38,,"It was the best of times. I, you know, my son."
03:42,,"While he was in college, I kept telling him."
03:45,,Enjoy it.
03:46,,"Back then Grinnell was, um, I lived on campus just my freshman year."
03:53,,And then I went off campus and student housing and then I lived in.
03:57,,The houses around campus on high street on.
04:01,,"Yeah, um, on six."
04:04,,"Um, the, the atmosphere was very much, you know."
04:11,,I think I was the last class where 19 was the drinking age.
04:16,,The pub.
04:19,,I just remember just having a good old time with students and music.
04:23,,Was really important.
04:25,,"We're in the middle of Iowa, right?"
04:28,,"So bringing music on campus, bringing culture on campus was really important."
04:33,,And we did a lot of that during my time.
04:36,,Totally. Yeah.
04:40,,"And I think this is actually a perfect segue into the next sort of part of the interview, which is about Georgia herself."
04:46,,"Um, so we were just wondering, you know, first question."
04:49,,"Could you tell me about your first interaction or first impression, uh, with Georgia?"
04:53,,"Again, we know she was a little, you know, a little eccentric, if you will."
04:56,,"So just first interaction, first impression, um, whatever comes to mind."
05:00,,"So Michael Oxman, I think was the chair coordinator before me."
05:08,,"And when he was transitioning, he was graduating."
05:13,,"He said, you know, I think maybe this might be a good thing for you."
05:16,,"I can't remember, but somehow I got the gig."
05:20,,And I remember we had an office in the forum at the time.
05:25,,"The forum was the hub of student life, right?"
05:30,,"Um, it's where everything happened."
05:33,,"The forum, um, beach, as we called it, where all the kids hung out."
05:39,,"Probably akin to where you guys have, um, what do you have that now?"
05:45,,The Joe or the.
05:47,,"Yeah, the Joe Rosenfield center."
05:48,,Yeah.
05:49,,Yeah.
05:49,,Yeah.
05:49,,It's probably akin to what that is now for students.
05:52,,But back then it was a forum and Georgia had an office for her students in the forum.
05:58,,It was in the basement.
05:59,,And I remember my first interaction was I had like office hours where Georgia would call.
06:07,,Cause obviously we didn't have cell phones back then.
06:11,,"And we would, I would go into the office and my first interaction of course was on the phone with her."
06:17,,"And the two years, two and a half years that I worked with her, of course, I never met her."
06:23,,I only spoke to her over the phone and I never thought she was eccentric.
06:28,,I always thought she was this fabulous woman that had tons of stories.
06:34,,The majority of the time with her was absolutely doing business.
06:40,,This band's coming into town.
06:41,,"We need to do this, that, and the other."
06:43,,"But my, the majority of my time with Georgia was just listening to her tell stories."
06:50,,"You know, about the time she met this band."
06:53,,Jefferson Starship.
06:56,,The time Bruce Springsteen came on campus.
06:59,,The time this happened.
07:00,,So my time with her was just office hours and then listening to her talk about her life.
07:07,,While coordinating these fabulous bands.
07:11,,"And not only bands, not only music."
07:15,,But art on campus.
07:20,,"So the 1st meeting with her, I would say was."
07:23,,"You know, office in the forum talking around the phone, probably."
07:28,,Figuring out what we're going to do that.
07:30,,Academic here.
07:33,,"Right. And so just sort of following up on that, you know, as a concert chair."
07:40,,I'm just wondering if you could go into sort of working with her in the sense of like.
07:45,,"In the sense of the process, right?"
07:49,,"Like, how did you bring up bands?"
07:51,,Did you bring up bands to her?
07:52,,Did she bring up bands to you?
07:53,,"Was it sort of a two way street or just sort of the process of, you know, from."
07:58,,Yeah.
07:59,,"You know, I mean."
08:00,,From you rising up bands and booking.
08:00,,We're talking like almost 40 years ago.
08:03,,"So, I mean, what I remember was."
08:06,,Was at that point.
08:09,,It was more about.
08:12,,About me kind of.
08:14,,Recommending bands because I remember during my tenure.
08:19,,We got a lot of local Chicago bands to come on campus.
08:24,,Buddy Guy.
08:26,,Coco Taylor.
08:27,,I remember we got some reggae bands.
08:29,,Big Red and the professionals.
08:31,,And then we got some bigger things right that she was involved with.
08:36,,"I remember we had the count, Basie office truck come on campus."
08:40,,What was really one of the things that I remember during my time was the Twyla Tharp dancers.
08:47,,Came on campus.
08:48,,And if you know who the Twyla Tharp dancers are.
08:51,,"And if you're a dancer, that was big time, right?"
08:55,,"So, yeah, it was it was definitely a 2 way street."
08:59,,"In that she looked to the students to recommend, you know, what was the pulse of the time."
09:06,,"But then because of her correct connections in the music industry, she was able to pull in some bigger names."
09:14,,I kind of remember the Google dolls coming on campus or maybe David Jo Hanson.
09:20,,"Some big names came on campus because of her pull, right?"
09:25,,"So it was definitely a two way street, but she definitely like."
09:30,,Leaned into the students to kind of bring the present day artists on.
09:37,,Mm hmm.
09:38,,"Yeah, I mean, that makes sense."
09:39,,"One of the things that, you know, I've been sort of one of my main things that I've been working on this this year or this summer has been sort of compiling like a list of concerts at the college."
09:48,,"And just one of the things that's always that struck me while I've been doing it is just like it was always a really good mix of both people who, you know, used to potentially be in their prime, but, you know, are not as famous, but also really up to date artists."
10:05,,"And I think that really was only possible, right, if you took input from students as opposed to just saying, no, I'm going to book this band, I'm going to book this band or whatnot."
10:12,,"So, yeah, totally."
10:13,,"Yeah, she was definitely collaborative."
10:16,,"And, you know, because she wasn't out and about, she definitely used the students as a connector to what was going on, right?"
10:28,,"Yeah, and it's strange."
10:29,,"I mean, it never seemed weird to me that I never met her because I felt I was close to her because we talked on the phone every I want to say at one point probably every day."
10:43,,"Yeah, I feel like so many people that we've talked to just sort of have the same have the same memories right of talking on the phone."
10:50,,"And which is, you know, obviously, you know, I think one of the things we've been thinking about is just like, you know, if if if she was working today, obviously, there would be some sort of accommodation or, you know, working from home or remote or whatnot."
11:04,,"But obviously, you know, in the 60s and 70s and 80s, there wasn't that and just so I think it's I think it's really unique to be able to sort of make a connection with someone even though you've never technically met them right in person."
11:19,,"I really wonder if she was in this day and age, if she would be a person that would be on camera or off camera."
11:26,,There's a part of me that thinks that she would be off camera for some reason.
11:30,,"Yeah, I mean, I, I don't know. I wouldn't put a pastor. I think I think that would totally. Yeah. So, um."
11:37,,"Could you, uh, I guess guess we'll go, you know, you kind of touched on this, but do you have like a particular concert or particular event that you really, really remember that really impacted you during your time at Grinnell?"
11:49,,"Well, yeah, the file of our dancers, right when they came on campus, because I was a dancer. So that was big."
11:57,,"Um, buddy guy, big blues guy in Chicago is also a big one."
12:04,,"Um, we would do concerts at the time and Darby gymnasium, cause that was our big place. I don't think Darby's there anymore, but we would also do it in the forum, right?"
12:16,,"Um, the small intimate concerts."
12:19,,"And I, what I remember was like, we'd get a reggae band from Chicago to come in and they'd be in the north lounge of the forum."
12:28,,"Um, and it would literally like being in a nightclub in Chicago, if they would transform it, the lights would go down and you'd be in a red bar, um, in the north."
12:39,,"Um, lounge of the forum."
12:41,,"So, I mean, I think every, even though it's cloudy now, cause it's like 40 years ago, I remember everything was memorable, right?"
12:50,,Because you were bringing culture into the middle of Iowa.
12:55,,"Um, so every time something happened, you know, Coco Taylor was a huge blues musician back in the day when she came on campus, right?"
13:06,,"And catering to the bands, you know, I remember, you know, they would come on campus."
13:11,,That would be the easy part.
13:13,,"Once they got on campus, you know, how would college students, you know, kind of."
13:19,,Take care of these band members.
13:22,,"So, I mean, memorable absolutely for as a dancer, it was a twilight dancers."
13:28,,I remember when the count based the orchestra came on campus.
13:32,,That was a big thing.
13:33,,"Because that brought, um, not only the college community, but the town as well, because everybody knows who town based students."
13:43,,Right?
13:44,,"So, yeah."
13:45,,Yeah.
13:46,,"No, totally."
13:47,,Yeah.
13:48,,Perfect.
13:49,,Okay.
13:50,,"Um, could you just, you know, maybe talk a little bit about how, you know, other students, other students and faculty sort of perceived, sort of perceived Georgia during your time at the college?"
14:03,,"Yeah, she was, she was definitely a legend."
14:09,,"People knew of her, you know, the, the, the whispers in the halls was, you know, she has, you know, a rack of all the, she can't leave the house."
14:20,,"You know, that was, that was also always under the breath, but she was absolutely a legend and people, I think."
14:29,,Respected her.
14:31,,"Respected what she brought in her, um, the knowledge she had and the connection she had."
14:37,,I don't think anyone other than just people being curious.
14:41,,Right.
14:42,,I don't remember any ill talk or any kind of negative comments about her.
14:50,,People just accepted the way she worked.
14:53,,"You know, I would, I could be on the phone with her for two hours."
14:57,,"You know, um, I think the college, the students that knew of her kind of thought of her as a legend."
15:11,,And I know the administration kind of respected her brain trust.
15:18,,Right.
15:19,,"I know there was before me, there was some challenges with the administration that I heard of."
15:25,,"I don't have any first not had knowledge of it, but I do think she was highly respected for what she brought to the table."
15:33,,Right. Yeah.
15:36,,"And, you know, just, uh, the challenges of the administration."
15:39,,I wanted to talk to you.
15:40,,"Um, also just asking about you, you, uh, wrote a letter to the S and B."
15:46,,"Um, I believe it was in 1994."
15:48,,"I want to say, or something, something."
15:50,,They were probably doing something about Georgia.
15:52,,"Yeah, they were doing something about Georgia."
15:54,,Georgia.
15:55,,"And you were part of, I believe, three, uh, four concerts chairs who, um, wrote a letter sort of in defense, um, in defense of, uh, in defense of her."
16:04,,Right.
16:05,,"When she was, when she had her position being challenged."
16:07,,"Um, so I was just wondering if you could sort of go into your, um, if you could just sort of talk about that, like, like open ended, um, just, uh, sort of, I see."
16:16,,"I mean, it's, it's kind of what I've been talking to."
16:20,,"She, she was."
16:23,,She was.
16:24,,"If I remember as a young 19, 20, 21 year old, right."
16:33,,She was phenomenal.
16:35,,She was a mentor.
16:36,,She was someone I looked up to.
16:40,,"She revered my opinion, you know?"
16:45,,"And so when she was being attacked or being questioned, of course I came to her defense, you know, because she had been such a critical part of my growing up."
16:59,,"You know, who in your youth would give you that much authority to bring music culture, to have an opinion of what would come on to this great little college in the middle of Iowa."
17:18,,Right.
17:19,,"You know, and she did."
17:21,,"And I think the people that worked for her understood what an honor it was to have that, um, to have her think so tightly of you that she would even consider your opinion."
17:40,,Right.
17:41,,This is a woman that worked with huge talent.
17:45,,"And here I was a 19, 20, 21 year old, and she was listening to my opinion."
17:52,,"So, yeah, when she was having some challenges in terms of her value and worth."
17:58,,"I mean, I had to use my voice."
18:01,,"Yeah, no, I think that totally makes sense."
18:05,,"I mean, just, just, you know, sort of, sort of thinking about it from, I guess, my perspective as someone who, you know, has been a concert chair for the past two years."
18:13,,"Right. There definitely is that sense of like, you know, of, of people trusting in you."
18:18,,"Right. You know, you're dealing, you're dealing with, uh, you're dealing with the vast amount of money."
18:22,,"You're essentially, you know, dealing with the reputation of the college."
18:26,,"Right. Because you're interacting with your, you're sort of the people interacting with the, these highly regarded acts."
18:31,,"And so if you, you know, if you mess it up, then that could really, that could really go south."
18:36,,"So, yeah, that, that totally makes sense."
18:38,,"Um, yeah, so I think, you know, we talked about the, the controversies incidents."
18:42,,"Um, and, and we have, we've had so, I mean, just going through the S and B we've had, we've found so many, you know, during the sort of."
18:50,,"During the sort of like each conflict that she had with the college, I believe we, we've cataloged three of them."
18:56,,"Um, it was always front page news and the S and B and people were writing opinion articles, were writing letters, writing op-eds about all this other stuff, which has been just really interesting to really interesting to see."
19:08,,"Okay, um, so, um."
19:12,,"How were, uh, you know, how were concert to the student life impacted by the colleges, uh, financial situation at the time?"
19:19,,I don't.
19:24,,"I vaguely remember, like talking about budget."
19:30,,"With Georgia, but I don't remember it being a variable that was really."
19:37,,a challenge.
19:39,,"I mean, so."
19:41,,Grinnell has always had money.
19:44,,"I mean, Warren Buffett was on their board for so long that he blew up their endowment."
19:51,,To the size of Harvard.
19:55,,I don't remember.
19:56,,Lack of finances being a challenge back then.
20:03,,"As I said, I vaguely remember like Georgia mentioning the budget was lower one year, but it didn't stop us from bringing people on campus."
20:15,,I remember there was a regular stream of talent or culture being brought on.
20:21,,And I don't remember dollars being a challenge.
20:26,,Tell you the truth.
20:27,,No.
20:28,,Yeah.
20:29,,"And would you say, would you say a solid chunk of that is due to, you know, maybe due to the budget aspect, but also due to the fact that she had all these connections and was able to sort of work and worm around deals and whatnot."
20:39,,"Yeah, maybe she was a phenomenal negotiator."
20:45,,So I know that she was able to get people to come for a lot less than they were charging for other places.
20:53,,I know that.
20:54,,I know that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
20:58,,But I think that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
21:00,,And I think that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
21:02,,And I think that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
21:04,,And I think that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
21:06,,And I think that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
21:07,,And I think that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
21:08,,I think that she was able to get people to come for a lot of money.
21:09,,Absolutely.
21:10,,Yeah.
21:11,,Okay.
21:12,,"And then, you know, we talked about like sort of Georgia and her contributions as students feeling, I was just wondering, like, could you talk about, you know, how your friends or other students felt about, you know, the general sort of social sort of social program at the time, right?"
21:25,,"You know, you said being in the middle, being in the middle of Iowa, there it's a, you know, you're sort of perennially, you're sort of always fighting off the, you know, there's nothing to do this weekend."
21:34,,"Oh, no, there was always something to do."
21:38,,"So, as I said, I only lived on campus my first year, which was freshman year."
21:43,,"I was in Norris, West Norris third."
21:46,,"And I lived in Pine Tree House, and then I lived off campus in apartments."
21:52,,"There was never any lacking of social events, even if there wasn't something being brought on campus."
22:02,,There was always something to do.
22:05,,"Back in the day, watching a movie on a Saturday night in ARH was the place to be."
22:15,,And don't forget the drinking age at that time was 19.
22:20,,"Not that you need to drink to socialize, but it made a difference."
22:25,,The social atmosphere.
22:28,,It was always popping.
22:31,,"I mean, I always remember."
22:33,,"Having the choice of doing something, because there was always something going on."
22:38,,Or not.
22:40,,Not.
22:41,,"But yeah, it was very, it was a, it was a, it was a different time."
22:45,,Don't forget.
22:46,,We didn't have cell phones.
22:48,,We didn't have internet.
22:50,,We didn't have Snapchat or any of that stuff.
22:54,,So we literally had to interact with each other.
22:57,,I do remember lots of parties.
23:01,,There was Gardner Lounge.
23:03,,There was North Lounge.
23:05,,There was always something going on.
23:08,,"Because we had to, we didn't have the luxury of streaming Netflix."
23:13,,"And don't forget, we didn't have phones."
23:16,,"If I wanted to get a phone call from a family member, I'd have to schedule it."
23:22,,And there was a phone in the hallway.
23:25,,So it was a different time.
23:27,,"So the social interaction, I remember was very much popping back then."
23:33,,"So, so students were, students were happy is what you're saying."
23:37,,Students were happy.
23:38,,"Well, as happy as you can be, you know, as a young adult away from home."
23:44,,"So, yeah, it was, yeah, it was different."
23:47,,"So you must know the cult of Grinnell, right?"
23:52,,My best friends are from Grinnell.
23:54,,They are.
23:57,,They are.
23:58,,"I mean, my best friends right now in my life are my friends from Grinnell."
24:03,,"Yeah, I feel like, you know, it's just, I don't know."
24:09,,"There definitely is like a very, there's a lot of connection that I feel like happens when you're in sort of the, you know,"
24:13,,"you're in sort of a smaller place, smaller place, not a ton to do sort of outside, not a ton to do outside of the college."
24:23,,"And something else that we actually talked about, I can't remember who this was with."
24:25,,"It might have been with a previous interviewee is, you know, now, now it's sort of very easy to sort of, I guess, an example of this is now it's sort of easy to, you know, like watch TV in your room or something like that."
24:40,,"You know, like if you want to watch the Super Bowl, you can watch it in your room and it's pretty easy."
24:44,,"But, you know, back in back in the really up until the up until the probably the late 2000s, you had to go to the lounge if you wanted to do something like that."
24:52,,And so there was just sort of perspective at all.
24:55,,There was the Jeopardy club.
24:58,,"If you wanted to watch Jeopardy, you go into the pub."
25:01,,There was a whole bunch of kids that would watch Jeopardy.
25:04,,All my children in the lounge.
25:06,,We couldn't we didn't watch TV in our room.
25:09,,Right. Perfect.
25:13,,Great. Okay.
25:14,,All right.
25:15,,So how did your how did your interactions with Georgia and concerts and just working as concerts chair?
25:24,,How did they impact your post for now your post Grinnell life in your career?
25:28,,Um.
25:34,,"I mean, as I said, she was a great mentor, so I'm sure she."
25:39,,She helped form the woman that I am.
25:43,,"I mean, I do work in the music industry now."
25:46,,I work for a company that manufacturers microphones and.
25:50,,I think that's a big part of what we do is support the music industry.
25:54,,But I don't know if that's a result of my work with Georgia.
25:57,,I think probably my work with Georgia.
26:00,,Probably helped me build some more self confidence as a female.
26:04,,"Um, because she was, she knew her stuff and she."
26:09,,"Took no prisoners, right? She was."
26:12,,"Other than my mom and my grandmother, she's probably."
26:15,,Along with Ilsa lighting her that other professor I talked about.
26:19,,"She was one of the very powerful, strong women."
26:23,,"That I saw, even though I never met her."
26:25,,I don't even I don't think at the time I don't even know what that I knew what she looked like.
26:31,,"I mean, I don't remember ever seeing a picture of her."
26:36,,Like a current day picture.
26:38,,I might have seen a picture back in the 50s or 60s.
26:42,,But a current day picture of her.
26:44,,I don't even remember if I knew what she looked like.
26:46,,She was just a voice on the phone.
26:49,,So I think in terms of how it impacted my post Grinnell.
26:53,,"Probably personally, you know, showed me what could be."
26:58,,In terms of a woman who is powerful and knows her stuff.
27:02,,"Professionally, I don't think it had a direct impact on me."
27:06,,But I did kind of end up in the music industry somehow.
27:10,,"Right. Yeah. I mean, it's really interesting."
27:14,,You mentioned sort of the.
27:15,,"The strong, the strong woman aspect, especially."
27:19,,"You know, looking, you know, one of the things, especially the conflict that she had with the college in the 70s."
27:26,,"If I remember correctly, I believe the president at the time wanted to eliminate her position in a couple of other ones."
27:31,,But all of these positions that they were trying to eliminate were positions held by women and they were trying to sort of mold it all together and put it in some.
27:40,,"Some guy who did who, according to the according to the opinion S&B section did not have the qualifications to do so."
27:48,,"And so, yeah, I mean, that totally that totally makes sense. Just, you know, very strong."
27:53,,"You know, she right. She, she just knew her stuff, right? She, she was, she was really good at what she did and."
27:59,,She knew her stuff and she knew her stuff. No one could.
28:03,,Debate that nobody could question it. Right.
28:06,,Right. Totally. Yeah.
28:09,,"Okay. I don't know if I have any like more written questions. I just, you know, I just."
28:17,,"You know, is there anything else that you anything else that you'd like to share?"
28:21,,"Anything else that you'd like to share about your time with Georgia, about your time at Grinnell?"
28:26,,"Really the floor is yours. No, I mean the little college that could in the middle of Iowa."
28:32,,"I mean, for me."
28:36,,It was a powerful place to be.
28:39,,"As I said, you know, I turned 60 this year."
28:43,,And I'm still closely connected to Grinnell.
28:48,,"You know, not even the college itself, just the community."
28:53,,"I would literally say, you know, if I have five best friends, four of them are from Grinnell."
29:02,,"So it was very, it was a time in my life that kind of molded me."
29:10,,"And, you know, and Georgia was a part of that."
29:13,,She was a very strong and huge part of that.
29:17,,The two years I spent with her was very powerful.
29:22,,And I hope she gets all the the accolades she deserves.
29:27,,What are you doing with this?
29:29,,What are you planning on doing with this research research or?
29:32,,"Well, so actually, that's a great question."
29:34,,"I mean, so we're going to put a transcript of this interview on line and sort of the main sort of the main sort of thesis, if you will, or the main start of this project is that Georgia did really did not get the accolades that she deserved while she was at the college, nor when she graduated."
29:54,,And you could probably say a part of that is because she didn't want them.
29:58,,"She, she, she didn't want them, but."
30:01,,"I think that, you know, a lot of some alumni who some alumni who worked with her were, you know, they just said, you know, that we worked with Georgia."
30:10,,"She had a profound impact on us and we, we don't think that she got the accolades she deserves."
30:16,,And so that's how this project started.
30:18,,"And one of the things that we discovered while we were doing the project, doing preliminary research was that there's not a lot of not a lot of written down history in the archives of."
30:31,,"She has a, she has an obituary apparently that she wrote herself actually, which is a fun fact that my, that my coworker, Maya was able to find out."
30:40,,"She has the obituary, she has the Grinnell magazine article that came out in like the late 2000s, but there isn't a lot of other information."
30:47,,And so one of the things that we sort of.
30:50,,"Sort of decided was that the main way that we were going to be able to bring sort of collect research on Georgia was to do oral history interviews with the folks that work with her. Right."
31:02,,"And so we're going to sort of put a transcript of this on the website we have, we're creating a website with information."
31:09,,"So my, so Maya, my good friend and coworker is working on a biography of, you know, a biography of Georgia."
31:17,,"So from when she was, when she was a little kid and athlete to when she worked at the college, we've been able to go to Ackley, the Ackley Historical Society, the Ackley library and sort of look at sources there."
31:32,,"And then Jackie note taker here has been doing work on just sort of concerts in the context of the college with other, with other, with other people."
31:44,,"And then I've been focusing on, like I said earlier, a timeline."
31:47,,"So sort of the goal of this project is, I think, twofold."
31:50,,"The first one is to sort of make sure that Georgia, you know, that Georgia gets her flowers right as someone who."
31:56,,"As someone who, I mean, I personally come to the conclusion after the past year or so of research that she is a top five most influential person to ever work at the college, just in terms of cultural impact."
32:08,,"When you, when you, you know, when I talk to alums and I, you know, I can from alums of essentially any year from, you know, from 1960 to 2001, I can always say, you know, Georgia Dentel."
32:18,,"And they'll be like, oh, I remember this concert. I remember this concert or whatever."
32:21,,And so it's clearly. So that's sort of one of the parts.
32:23,,"And the other part is to sort of catalog the history of Grinnell concerts, because it's such an important part of the college's history that really does not get talked about a lot."
32:36,,"And so those are sort of the two, those are sort of the two aspects of it. Right."
32:39,,Okay.
32:40,,"And yeah, I mean, we've, I've had a ton of fun creating the website. It's definitely going to take a while. I mean, putting together these oral history interviews, putting together this timeline or whatnot, but it's been a lot of fun."
32:50,,"Did you send me, can you send me the link to the website?"
32:54,,"Yeah, of course I can definitely do that. Perfect. And just actually one. Can I just ask you one last question? I just thought about it. I was just wondering if you could, you mentioned sort of the town community. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the college town relations when you were, when you were at the college."
33:13,,"Oh, well, there was definitely a divide, right? Between college and townies."
33:23,,"Um, it depends. Um, I don't think it was the best. Um, the college definitely overran the town at the time. Right. And the town was still growing. I think, you know, we had a dairy queen."
33:47,,"And that's about it. I remember taking road trips to Marshall town or going to rag stock in Iowa city. So the town and the college wasn't, I don't think."
34:06,,"It was on the best terms. I don't, I don't ever. Um."
34:11,,It was the 1st place I was called the N word.
34:14,,One of the 1st places.
34:16,,By a townie as I was walking.
34:18,,"Um, into town."
34:21,,But I never felt unsafe there though.
34:24,,"I never felt unsafe in Grinnell, but I don't think it was the greatest."
34:28,,"Yeah, no, I mean just scanning through the just scanning through the S and B's at that time. I mean, I think you can definitely."
34:38,,"Can definitely see that. But, you know, I think I just think that, you know."
34:44,,"I don't know having having an institution like having an institution like Grinnell in a city like Grinnell is bound to cause, you know, some sort of."
34:53,,There's always going to be there's always going to be that divide. Right.
34:56,,"Oh, absolutely. Absolutely."
34:58,,"But as I said, I don't, I've never felt unsafe there."
35:02,,But I know it wasn't greatest.
35:05,,"Actually, I feel when I go back now, I feel, I feel like it's better for some reason."
35:14,,"And I don't know, maybe I'm just older and, and, and walking slower, but I don't know how it is for the kids now, but."
35:22,,I don't know.
35:23,,"Yeah, we've had a couple, we've had a couple of incidents."
35:26,,"Just with just with, you know, racism in general, from the, from that."
35:31,,I was in an alumni group.
35:34,,We were talking about that.
35:36,,"Yeah, which is that's unfortunate. I do think that the general sort of, I, I, you know, I, I think there's, there's a, you know, like I said, you know, like you said, I think there's going to be that divide in general, but I also think that, you know, music and these sort of public events as a whole can do a large part to sort of."
35:51,,"bring that divide together. I mean, you mentioned."
35:55,,"Count Basie, right? The orchestra, you know, everybody knew who he was. And so they were, you know, the town community was showing up as well as."
36:00,,"Absolutely. I think, um, because when things like that happened, it would absolutely bring the, the out together."
36:09,,"because, um, it would be a time when the walls will come down and people."
36:16,,"Would just be there to, you know, to enjoy the culture."
36:20,,So it was definitely a uniting thing.
36:23,,"Totally. Okay. I mean, I don't think I don't have anything else. Jackie, do you have anything else? Are we all good?"
36:30,,"Uh, I don't really think I have anything else just besides adding that. Yeah, the most, uh, townspeople. I think I've ever seen on campus at 1 time was the."
36:43,,"Slopeful concert this past spring. So, uh."
36:46,,"Uh, yeah, credit credit to you Hayden for that 1. I guess."
36:51,,"All right, perfect. Well, I think I thank you so much for this. This was, this was been a, this has been a pleasure."
36:57,,"And to me, though."
36:59,,I love to see that website.
37:01,,Totally. We will follow up. So I'll follow up with the link to the website as well as Jackie will follow up.
37:06,,We'll follow up with a electronically signable PDF. So that can be easy and then we'll take care of that.
37:12,,Perfect. Thank you so much.
37:14,,All right. Thank you so much. Have a good rest of your day.
37:16,,Bye bye.
37:18,,Bye bye.
37:19,,Thank you.
