,Bowen Wei '25,  00:00:19, Okay‚ so this Georgia Dentel project oral history interview is conducted on July 15 2024 by  Bowen Wei. The interviewee is Ed Senn‚ class of 1979 and Maya Albanese is the notetaker for  this interview. Before we start the interview‚ could you please reveal the legal release one last  time and confirm that you gave consent to this interview.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:00:50, I can confirm that I signed the legal release and I do give consent for this interview. 
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:00:55, Thank you so much sir. So‚ to start this interview‚ would you like to introduce yourself?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:01:04, My name is Ed Senn. I'm a class of 1979. I am a biology major and I am a retired executive from  Verizon Corporation‚ where I worked for 27 years. As primarily the last one as vice president‚  public policy state government relations  
,Bowen Wei '25, 0:01:29, Okay‚ thank you so much. So‚ you're from York‚ South Carolina‚ right? Is that correct? 0 
,Ed Senn '79, 0:01:37, Yes‚ I was born and raised in South Carolina on a dairy farm.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:01:45, Gotcha. So‚ why did you choose Grinnell? 
,Ed Senn '79,  00:01:51, Well‚ my high school‚ last three years of high school‚ were spent in Falls church‚ Virginia. I  thought that I would be going to the University of Virginia or the College of Wayman and Mary. 
,Ed Senn '79,  00:02:08, I actually went to a New Year's Eve party and there were two individuals there that were from  my same high school but older and one was going to Grinnell and the other was going to  Simpson College. And they both suggested that it would be advantageous to see a different part  of the country and recommended Grinnell and Simpson.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:02:32, And I had received information from Grinnell‚ which I‚ you know‚ through in a box and pulled it  out and filled out the information and sent it in and then I received a call from biology professor  since I expressed interest in that and I received a call from our swim coach.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:02:52, Since I was a swimmer in high school‚ I‚ applied to Grinnell and they offered me a very  generous financial aid package and said essentially that whatever I thought I was going to pay to  go to a state‚ in state school‚ is what I would pay a Grinnell. Obviously I would work and have  loans and.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:03:14, a financial aid package‚ but that. So I decided to come and visit and I did. In those days‚ you  flew to Des Moines‚ you got yourself from Des Moines airport into the Greyhound bus station  and you took a Greyhound bus to Grinnell. I had never been.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:03:37, Beyond the Mississippi and‚ when I got on the bus and I‚ we were coming out to Grinnell. I  noticed that A. there weren't any trees except by the‚ by the creeks or rivers that are in the towns‚  and two that.
,Ed Senn '79, 00:03:57, The Earth was‚ the dirt was black. I grew up with red clay. And‚ a third that‚ Iowa was not flat  that they were rolling hills‚ very similar to Grantwood. And when I came to visit on campus‚ I  was met by the student post.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:04:19, Spent the weekend at the Grinnell house‚ which is where prospective students were put up. And  went to classes and started snowing‚ and it was‚ you could say it was love at first sight. I really   thought that this would be the right place to be for four years.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:04:39, And it turned out to be one of the best decisions that I’ve made in my life.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:04:43, Thank you. Yeah‚ Grinnell has a lot of good scenery‚ I'll say. So‚ what were your first  impressions of the town and the college?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:05:02, Yeah‚ first‚ that I would be spending four years in a rural setting‚ which was fine. The second  was that the campus was very self contained‚ that everything was there from the academics to  student life‚ to athletics.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:05:26, And third that the campus was beautiful. It was‚ looked like a wonderful place to spend your four  years studying and preparing for my future.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:05:40, Yes. So since you mentioned that you studied biology earlier this interview.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:05:50, And last time when we had our pre-interview‚ could you elaborate why you chose to major in  biology besides that a biology professor contacted you?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:06:07, Okay.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:06:12, Well‚ first I was always interested in sciences. My mother was a biology teacher in junior high.  Second is that when we were in Grinnell‚ basically the advisors said that.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:06:32, you should major in what you like because it's going to be very‚ very‚ very hard. And you're  probably gonna get a med school‚ law school or graduate school. And I love the‚ I love the  biology.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:06:50, Courses and the professors. And my third was probably I didn't like writing papers‚ you know.  And the biology department and the math department were less. There were more hands on labs‚  results‚ than
,Ed Senn '79,  00:07:10, Than writing the 20 page paper.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:07:13, Yeah‚ the paper part is very‚ very relatable. Grinnell is very‚ provides a very ambitious education  in social sciences and humanities.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:07:29, Well‚ the writing skills that Grinnell teaches you are very important and very key to general‚ at  least for me‚ for a very successful career and being able to express yourself both with the written  word and with the spoken word.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:07:48, Grinnell provides a very strong background so that you can communicate and‚ perhaps‚ persuade  perhaps‚ report‚ perhaps‚ you know‚ build a‚ a career which enhances‚ you know‚ your time with  other people.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:08:11, Yes‚ definitely. So‚ could you also describe your favorite class‚ favorite professor or your  academic advisor?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:08:23, 36 
,Ed Senn '79,  00:08:26, Well‚ my‚ those are tough‚ tough questions. So let's take them in reverse order. My academic  advisor‚ you know‚ obviously was my freshman tutorial‚ which was in the biology department. It  was mans moles‚ and microbes. And we studied Chemos‚ the plague‚ the book the plague.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:08:46, Like and‚ so I had‚ I ended up with the chair of the department being my last advisor who gave  me great advice in coaching and he was the crust professor in those days.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:09:03, You know‚ he probably drank 50 cups of coffee a day and he smoked cigarettes at his desk and  he had a gravity voice. And he‚ he said “Senn‚ you have a problem finding the right answers.  Why don't you focus on getting the right questions?” And I was like‚ well‚ that's a pretty good  idea.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:09:23, And‚ so he‚ Professor Fishman was dedicated to his students and to the college. You know‚ my  favorite professor‚ tough call but probably Professor Dixarvene who was in the art department  and‚ very‚ very talented artist in his unwrite. Ave Grinnell alumnis.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:09:49, And he‚ taught‚ art history‚ world Art history class or American art history‚ eight o’clock in the  morning‚ and‚ he‚ he brought it to life. And I think if you talk to any other students who had.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:10:08, A Professor Cervine‚ you would encounter sort of this spirit and joy of life that he embodied  and‚ was just a wonderful.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:10:29, Ambassador for the college and inspiration.   Bowen: Yeah‚ so how would you describe the sort of‚ the influences of our history on your  during your time in Grinnell?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:10:51, Well‚ first of all‚ it's outside of the science department‚ which I think is important in a liberal  arts education‚ in exploring various parts of the college. Second is that
,Ed Senn '79,  00:11:18, When a professor‚ you know‚ loves their subject or has such an enthusiasm for the subject that  they're teaching‚ it's somewhat contagious and it helps you develop a certain appreciation for that  subject.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:11:38, And so I have a greater appreciation for art‚ due to professor Cervine. And third
,Ed Senn '79,  00:11:54, Having the science background‚ you know‚ providing balance and seeing beauty‚ whether it's in  the cell‚ formations or‚ in a painting of Grant Wood.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:12:13, I can still recall that one of the papers‚ maybe the major paper I wrote on it‚ was about‚ that was  for American artistory‚ was on.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:12:31, They were called Happenings. It was in the sixties and‚ the artists would‚ you know‚ it might  think of Annie Linux and performance art now with musical artists‚ but.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:12:49, They open up‚ you know‚ Art opens up different avenues for both thinking about issues‚  problems‚ ideas‚ and‚ he certainly opened up‚ many many doors for me..
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:13:07, So‚ it seems that your life at Grinnell was very artsy and both very encompassed both science  and a lot of the very artsy stuff‚ is that correct?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:13:27, I don't know‚ I don't know how you define Artsy stuff. I mean you can I can say to you that I  was a singer‚ while I was there‚ we had a student organized group called the Celestial Sacred  Harp Singers. Student ran‚ student organized.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:13:47, Where we sang early American religious folk music‚ which is shape notes. It's still sung today.  But you know we would.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:14:02, During exam times‚ we would sing in the library or in the dining halls to provide‚ a little joy for  the students that were there. But I also
,Ed Senn '79,  00:14:19, I was on the judicial council. I was also on the first men's volleyball team at the college. I was‚ I  was in the biology department‚
,Ed Senn '79,  00:14:39, It was a student advisory group‚ but I don't know what S‚ I think we were the SEPCs or  something like that‚ where you went to faculty meetings or gave advice on hiring and things like  that. So I‚ and I was also in a play.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:14:57, You know‚ I wanted to‚ and I encourage‚ you know‚ other students to try to have as the broadest  of the experience as you can. I mean‚ the ability at Grinnell to try different things and.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:15:16, It's a once in a lifetime experience. I‚ when I would advise high school students during my  career‚ my advice was‚ you know‚ college is the gift you give yourself.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:15:35, Choose wisely. If you want to go to a big state school and have a marching band and you know‚  80‚000 people in a stadium for a football game‚ have at it. If you want to be able to walk over to  a football game for a college that you don't have to pay for admission
,Ed Senn '79,  00:15:55, If you want to be able to play in a sport‚ you want to be in a play and you're not a theater major‚  check out the small liberards colleges. Taking advantage of all the opportunities.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:16:09, So since that you mentioned there were a lot of activities you could do at Grinnell during your  time. So‚ how did that impact your life after graduation?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:16:40, Yeah I think the impact was that it gave me confidence to try new things.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:16:48, To‚ develop a‚ try to develop a culture or a ethos of learning
,Ed Senn '79,  00:17:05, And to be open to new ideas or new challenges‚ whether it's yeah‚ I studied French for one year  under Madam Berkowitz but I've been.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:17:26, And I studied Italian. Now‚ you know‚ I played sports when I was at Grinnell‚ now I played  pickleball. I‚ they tried to instill right for me. They instilled a love of learning‚ which I tried to  continue today.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:17:50, Gotcha.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:17:59, So‚ since you mentioned that Grinnell provided a lot of opportunities for the students‚ how would  you describe the general atmosphere or student culture in a broader way during your time at  Grinnell?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:18:28, The general atmosphere or the student culture?  Bowen: Yeah‚ the culture on campus.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:18:41, In the 70s‚ we did not have a central dining hall‚ like you do today. We had two dining halls‚ one  in Quad and one in Coles. So generally you‚ we were much more divided into north campus and  south campus than you are today‚
,Ed Senn '79,  00:19:04, personally dining in Quad was‚ you know‚ wonderful. I watched dishes there for several years.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:19:23, So the physicality of the campus led to sort of the north campus‚ south campus split‚  distinctions‚ you know.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:19:40, If you wanted to be closer to the library or you were in the south campus. If you wanted to be  closer‚ you know‚ to the athletic fields‚ you were in north campus. Maybe some of that still exists  today. A seoond thing is that.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:19:57, When we were there‚ the drinking age was 18. So‚ that meant that we had a pub on campus.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:20:13, Which was‚ I don't know‚ you know‚ below main‚ below the Quad. And so you really didn't‚ if   you wanted a beer‚ you didn't go downtown‚ you just went to the pub. So it was much more self  contained‚ maybe it's the right word.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:20:29, And third would be under the culture and which sort of leads into the work that Georgia Dentel  did for the college and for the students when she was an administrator there is that our weekends  were full.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:20:49, Our weeks were full of events. And so there was never the idea that you would leave campus to  go anywhere on the weekends. I mean that would be sort of like why?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:21:13, So it was sort of like a nice little bubble‚ if you will‚ that's not the right term. But it was sort of‚  you didn't need to go to Des Moines or Iowa City or Chicago for the weekends. We had stuff  going on that you could just walk to.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:21:33, Yeah. So for the sort of north and south divide‚ we still kind of have that divide right now‚ South  is kind of like party scene and north is more athletics.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:21:51, And the east east campus is more like people who want to study and wanna be quiet. So that is  very relatable for us now. Since last time during our pre-interview‚ you mentioned that there  were weekly event calendars distributed to every student's mailbox on campus.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:22:11, So how does that sort of create a sense that every weekend you have a lotta stuff going on? How  does that influence your life?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:22:34, You talk to your classmates and your friends and sort of said‚ well‚ are you gonna go to the  movie tonight or are you going to the lecture? What are you gonna wear to the all campus dance   on Saturday night? You know‚ because‚ you know‚ were you gonna go to the theater‚ the music‚  the film? What were your friends going to do you know? Or who you're gonna hang out with?
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:23:13, Gotcha. So since there is a sort of a general student culture on events‚ how would you describe  the political culture on campus during your time?
,Ed Senn '79,  00:23:40, The political culture. I was there from 75 to 79.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:23:54, So‚ you know‚ Jimmy Carter was elected president in 1976. So‚ we‚ the Iowa caucuses‚ were big  in‚ you know‚ 76.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:24:11, And to‚ I guess a lesser extent than you know‚ when Carter was the incumbent. So‚ for the 76  election‚
,Ed Senn '79,  00:24:28, We had‚ we had Jimmy Carter‚ we had Fred Harris from Oklahoma‚ we had Moyudal‚ we‚ I  mean we had a variety of candidates that would come and speak on campus.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:24:48, Primarily maybe in South Lounge‚ which was like a campus living room‚ where you would have  meetings and things like that‚ a very intimate setting‚ sometimes in Herrick Chapel.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:25:05, So‚ politically‚ involvement was part of the culture‚ I would say. I mean Iowa being the first  cacus was very helpful in helping with our political education.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:25:24, We had Republicans that would come and speak on campus. I think John Anderson may have   been there.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:25:39, He was a Republican Congressman from Illinois who actually ran for president‚ as a Republican  in the 1980. But besides having sort of the focus on the caucuses‚ you would also have‚ you  know‚ regular lectures‚ guest lectures that came to campus.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:25:59, I mean‚ but the history of Grinnell's quote political involvement or political was very well  known. I think you know Truman came to campus in the probably in the sixties after his  presidency‚ I think Eisenhower may have been there too.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:26:31, I’m not sure about Herbert Hoover. But‚ you know‚ the state of Iowa has always been active  politically. In those days you would probably say it was more bipartisan because of just the  nature of the state was one that the governor‚ in the sixties‚ was a Democrat in the 70s. I think  that was when‚ you know‚ Bobrey as a Republican came in. So I mean it's I'm not certain of the  question of political involvement.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:27:06, Is that‚ you know‚ besides having that‚ you've had alumni‚ who have been‚ you know‚ politically  involved‚ currently congressman‚ Tom Cole from Oklahoma. A Republican Chair of the House  rules committee. But you know‚ Alan‚ former Congressman Alan Weed‚ a Democrat from  Kansas City was a member of Congress in the 80s.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:27:45, Former Congressman Tom Rails back‚ Republican from Illinois‚ was in Congress‚ I think in the  70s and the early 80s. So‚ you know‚ and then of course I mean historically‚ you know‚ Harry  Hopkins was an alumnus of the college who was very involved in the Truman administration.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:28:05, Hallie Flanagan ran the Federal theater program during the depression. And obviously‚ you  know‚ JB Grinnell was an abolitionist Republican member of Congress‚ you know‚ during the  civil war.
,Ed Senn '79,  00:28:31, So‚ historically I would sort of say‚ we have a‚ we have a pretty strong historical political  background with the college. The history of the college is fascinating.
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:28:39, Yes‚ definitely. How would you say about the sort of the grassroots‚ the student involvement‚  and politics during your time? Kind of like student protests and student initiatives?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:29:01, Oh‚ well‚ I think‚ we protested‚ I guess I would say the first‚ student protest that.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:29:16, I remember or was involved with was when Georgia Dentel‚ the administrator in charge of our  student life extracurricular films concerts‚ when the president‚ the Dick Turner tried to fire her.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:29:35, In the‚ I think in 76 maybe‚ in a cost reduction move because the finances of the college were in  question that the student protested and.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:29:52, The faculty protested. They said if these students don't have stuff to go to‚ they're not gonna‚ you  know‚ that will be felt and then the alumni protested‚ and Turner reversed his decision and  rehired her. I think maybe half time‚ but he rehired her.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:30:10, So‚ you know‚ I think political and the farm worker movement in California was involved in.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:30:26, My students‚ and during our era. That was more Caesar Shavez in the California workers issue.  You know‚ South Africa divestment was more of an issue in the 80s.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:30:44, You know‚ there was a movement‚ you know‚ in the most recent past regarding the divestment  of fossil fuels issues. So you know‚ students‚ the political interests‚ activities‚ involvement I think  is very reflective of the times that the general mood of the country if you will.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:31:11, Gotcha. So‚ you talked about how students and faculty protested against Turner's decision to fire  Georgia. It ties very well to the question about your first impression of Georgia. So‚ what was  your first impression of her?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:31:38, Well‚ I never met Georgia Dentel. Very few people did. You knew who she was. Her profile  increased when the president tried to fire her‚ and we learned exactly what she did. And then  during my tenure there‚ you would see her‚ you know‚ walking across campus‚ generally with  gloves on.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:32:13, And I was a Forum desk attendant in my senior year‚ which is the head of the student union‚  activities dealing with concerts or anything that was in south lounge speakers eh‚ you know‚ and.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:32:32, So she had an office there‚ but when you ask about first impressions‚ it would be sort of like‚  well‚ never met her. But‚ I was very aware of what she did to make our extracurricular time at  Grinnell very meaningful.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:32:51, So‚ would you say that she was a very sort of influential figure on student activities but  remained kind of enigmatic?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:33:08, Well‚ that might be one way you could describe her. I think that those people that work directly  with Georgia and there are several articles that talk about those students that work directly with  her to let them to describe her. I would have said that she was somewhat reclusive.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:33:34, Gotcha. So how do students in general and faculty perceive Georgia and her contributions to the  student life?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:33:53, Yeah‚ I would say that both students and faculty recognize the important component of what  extracurricular activities that Georgia. The importance of those in extracurricular activities that  Georgia brought to the college. The involvement from concerts‚ and entertainment. And the  importance of having fun or finding joy or‚ outside of studying was well recognized by the  students and by the faculty.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:34:41, I mean you take a look at the list of artists that she brought in. You‚ you look‚ at her involvement  in educating students on what you might want to call arts management. Issues that we have  alumni who are involved in the arts because of her impact on them and on the college.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:35:23, Yes‚ so I'm currently trying to schedule an interview with Hudson Miller. Do you have any sorts  of insights on him?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:35:36, No‚ he's younger than I am. I know who I know who he is‚ but‚ I have no. I really don't know  him.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:35:51, Gotcha. So‚ how do students and faculty react to Richard Turner's decision to fire Georgia  besides protest?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:36:12, Oh‚ well looking back‚ I would sort of say that it was a lobbying campaign to keep her position.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:36:32, In lining up support with the faculty. And‚ you could talk to Professor Don Smith or Professor  Gerald Lalonde. And the articles written‚ you know‚ mentioned the late Joe Wall.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:36:50, You had that side of the equation weighing in with the president and the administration on the  value that Georgia brought to the college. Secondly‚ you had students that were‚ you know‚  protesting‚ meeting‚ you know.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:37:10, And then third‚ you know‚ you had the alumni‚ outreach to the alumni or the trustee community‚  which I think is mentioned in one of the articles as far as‚ lending their support for maintaining  Georgia's position and the value that it added to the college to its reputation‚ to the recruitment of  students. I mean‚ she was a tremendous asset for the college.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:37:39, Gotcha. So‚ did Georgia sort of motivate and did her events motivate a lot of students to apply to  Grinnell? Is that correct?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:38:02, I don't know how to answer that question. You would have to do‚ you know‚ research‚ but‚ as far  as the.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:38:16, You know‚ and I can't remember the names of the guides to the colleges during the 70s. There  might have been something called the “Underground Guide to Colleges.” That would be an  interesting thing‚ but so I specifically cannot point to any source that would say that because of  Grinnell's extracurricular activities that was influential in our admissions process. Worthy of  further research.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:38:45, Gotcha. So during our pre-interview last time‚ you mentioned that you worked as a student guide  during your time at Grinnell. Did you talk about the amount of events that Georgia brought to the  college‚ to the prospective students?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:39:11, Well yes‚ when you were giving a tour of campus to a group‚ generally one of their questions or  areas of interest was‚ well‚ what do you all do besides studying? And to be able to articulate the  various concerts or artists that came onto campus was very helpful. It was a‚ you know‚ it was a  topic of interest of prospective students and we had a very good story to tell and‚ you know‚  having been there for Bruce Springstein concert‚ it was in Darby Gym.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:39:57, You know‚ that was probably a highlight‚ but we had other‚ non rock and roll artists that would  come in. Whether it was‚ you know‚ blues or jazz Cocoa Taylor from Chicago‚ or Gil Scott  Heron or‚ you know‚ folk singers or Julie Harris who did the one woman show the Bell of  Amerst or moment shots a‚ I think there were a Swiss group that was‚ you know‚ touring the  country. Yes‚ highlighting the non academic strengths of the college would be an important  component of being a tour guide on campus.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:40:51, Yeah. Gotcha. So since there were a lot of events during that time‚ how do students feel about  all of the social programs provided by Georgia?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:41:17, How did students feel about the programs provided by Georgia? Strongly supportive‚ incredibly  impressed and thankful for guidance and leadership.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:41:32, Sure. Gotcha. If I may ask‚ how did the LGBT community during that time feel about the  events. Were they included‚ were they having fun?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:41:50, Well‚ you know‚ you'd have to go back to the time in the 70s‚ I can say on one hand‚ when I  came to visit‚ it was quote alternative Lifestyles weekend. And when they were showing the  movie Boys in the Band.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:42:18, And I'm sure that we had every year some sort of‚ what you would think of now as an LGBT‚  you know‚ activities.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:42:37, But it was a different‚ it was a different era. It's tough to‚ I mean it's tough to‚ I mean‚ there were  some people that were out‚ and it was‚ you know.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:42:53, Yeah‚ I think most‚ I mean most people just didn't care about that‚ which goes back to them  being insular‚ you know‚ where you can‚ you can be on campus and if you're at a campus event  and two people with the same sex are‚ are dancing together‚ it's sort of like‚ eh?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:43:10, But you’d have to go back and read some‚ you know‚ history of‚ I mean‚ of the time to put it in  perspective. I mean‚ we didn't have drag show.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:43:26, But I can't even‚ I mean‚ I can't even remember if the I mean‚ I don't even think there was a‚ I  mean if there was a gay bar Des Moines‚ I didn't know about it. I mean.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:43:43, It's tough to look back or to ask that question where it's sort of like‚ well‚ during the 70s‚ it was a  little‚ it was different‚ you know. Coming out really wasn't a thing until the 80s. I mean‚ this was  in the pre-Aids time you know‚ so I don't know how to answer that question.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:44:14, Gotcha. So‚ is there a concert or event that you remember particularly well during your time?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:44:30, Can we pause this interview so I can. Take another quick call on the phone. Is that ok?  Bowen:Oh‚ yeah‚ definitely. Yes.   All right‚ then I'm gonna go on mute and stop. I'll be right back.  Bowen: Okay‚ thank you.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:45:01, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:45:21, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:45:41, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:46:01, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:46:21, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:46:41, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:47:01, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:47:21, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:47:41, Okay‚ uh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:48:01, Okay‚ I'm back.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:48:21, At a car dealership having some work done that I needed to respond to. Sorry about that.  Bowen WeiYeah‚ no worries.  Ed Senn:You asked about favorite concert?  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:48:32, Yeah favorite concert or your favorite event.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:48:39, Favorite event.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:48:46, But everyone's gonna say‚ you know‚ Bruce Springsteen or many people will say Bruce  Springstein. I guess I might offer a different perspective in that. That was in the old darby gym.  The events that‚ I might‚ have you focus on or have you look at are the ones that are in‚ were in  south lounge‚ that might have provided a more‚ you know‚ intimate club life‚ club is the wrong  term.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:49:38, Space‚ Cocoa Taylor‚ from Chicago. I'd looked her up‚ she came several times when we were  there and‚ if you go into South Lounge and imagine all of the cubicles gone.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:49:58, That gives you an idea of‚ much more of a living room space that she performed in. Or‚ you  know‚ Mo Udal or Jimmy Carter would‚ you know‚ speak in south lounge.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:50:20, And then‚ Robert's Theater‚ where Gils Scott Heron performed‚ you know‚ you had much more  of an intimate or Julie Harris Developma was in Robert. So the.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:50:37, The settings which provided a greater intimacy with the artists would be ones that I might say  would be interesting to look at. And I think that in some of the lists I've seen of the various  concerts that alumni have been providing‚ you know‚ they indicate the space‚ where they‚ where  they performed.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:50:56, Yeah‚ there was also an all college convocation in‚ was it 67‚ where Martin Luther King spoke  in Darby? But I would take a look at that program.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:51:18, Because it‚ in addition to Martin Luther King‚ you had various other speakers‚ and or artists‚ I  think the artist Rochemberg's folk‚ it was probably an opera singer.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:51:37, It might be interesting to see if there are any threads about Georgia Dentel's involvement in that  convocation. I mean that was huge. I mean‚ in addition to having Martin Luther King there on  campus‚ you know‚ giving the‚ the keynote at the weekend. It was a‚ it was a major event in the  history of the College.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:52:02, Gotcha. So‚ how would you describe the college financial situation during that time? How did  college afford to just arrange so many events for students?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:52:23, Well‚ you'd need to‚ you would need to to talk with those students who were much more  involved in the planning and the preparation. Albeit‚ the college's finances during the 70s were  not as‚ what do you want to say‚ robust‚ as they are today. It was only in the 70s that the college  began the trajectory of increasing the endowment under Joe Rosenfield's leadership that put the  college on the path where they are on today. Georgia had a budget as others would have‚ but her  skill set‚ if you will‚ was finding talent before‚ before they became big.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:53:31, I mean‚ she had Bruce Springsteen I think two years out. There's an article‚ I think it's two years‚  but she had the skill sets to and the contacts to get artists before they were big. I mean we had the  Jackson Five‚ you know‚ before they were big. I mean‚ we had Police‚ we had Sting before he  was big. Everything was sort of like‚ she was ahead of the curve‚ so that she was. And in this  article talks about‚ she would talk to the students and sort of say‚ ok‚ you can spend your budget  a lot on this one name band‚ or you can get others that are less well known.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:54:26, But‚ you know‚ we'll just be as entertaining‚ as exciting‚ and convincing the students. But those  questions are much better‚ much more‚ should be much more focused on those that had actual  interaction with Georgia and developing the budget that she provided. It wasn't like Grinnell had  so much money that they were able to get Bruce Springsteen. It's sort of like‚ no‚ we didn't. Read  the articles and understand what the facts are.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:54:56, Gotcha. So‚ what was the general student sort of feeling about the tight budget that Georgia had  to face.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:55:13, Well‚ I guess I would go back and sort of say talk to those who had to work with the budget. The  second thing is that.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:55:26, You really have to understand the college's finances were not what some people think that they  are today. During our era‚ the big news‚ if you will‚ and you'd have to do the research on this  cause that Joe Rosenfield‚ you know‚ brought in Warren Buffett‚ as a‚ you know‚ a trustee‚ as an  advisor to the college. Warren Buffett was at the Martin Luther King speech.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:56:01, But‚ yeah Joe Rosenfield‚ you know‚ wanted to‚ diversified the finances of the college. For  example‚ you'd have to do the research. But the college bought a TV station in Dayton‚ Ohio in  like 1972.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:56:19, And they bought it for X amount of dollars. Well‚ a college buying a TV station in the 70s was‚  let's call it‚ novel. Not what a lot of them did.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:56:34, I don't know if they were‚ you know. But then the college sold the TV station in the late 70s for‚  say‚ X times three.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:56:50, So‚ good investment‚ and Joe Rosenfield is the primary reason that the college is in the financial  position that it is today‚ in addition to various generous support from the alumni community‚  which we hope that the students will continue once they reach the alumni community.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:57:22, Gotcha. So the college's financial situation didn't get better until around 79. Is that correct?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:57:39, I don't‚ you would have to do the research on that. I don't know when‚ I mean‚ I would say it was  after‚ I mean‚ it was pointing in the right direction‚ but I mean that's why President Turner's  argument was that there had needed to be a tightening in the administration–administrative  position's budget. And so‚ because I think in one article he mentions that he goes back and forth I  think with Professor Wall on this as far as‚ you know‚ they hadn't tightened the administration  budget for 15 years. I mean it's‚ the history is out there. My recommendation is that you‚ if you  haven't read any of the books on the history of the college.  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:58:39, That might be helpful to give you a better feel of what the campus was like in the 70s‚ and I don't  know. I'm trying to think of the professor who wrote it. It might‚ if it's not Joe Wall‚ I'll have to  think about it‚ but it's in the bookstore. And‚ you know‚ all students should understand the history  of the college. I think it's very important from. It gives a perspective on‚ you know‚ where we  have been‚ indicates what direction the college is pointed in.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  00:59:11, Yes‚ definitely. So to wrap up this‚ this interview‚ how's your time at Grinnell influenced your‚  your career and life after graduation?  
,Ed Senn '79,  00:59:39, My time at Grinnell provided a very strong foundation for my future career and provided me  with the skill sets necessary to navigate a changing career. Some people‚ you know‚ come into  college and they know they want to be a dermatologist. And they go straight to be a  dermatologist. That wasn't my career path. Some people come into college and it go‚ you know‚  after college it goes one way and then another.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:00:27, And it comes back and goes back and forth‚ you know. Sometimes it's important to find out what  you don't like‚ in addition to finding something that you do like. Grinnell provided the necessary  skill sets‚ the ability to read and write‚ and think and analyze‚ in addition to having a strong set of  friends.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:01:08, And some of my best friends are my college cohorts. We just celebrated our 45th reunion with  over 70 of our classmates back. You know‚ I was best man at my‚ one of my college roommate’s  wedding.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:01:26, Our classmates came together to establish a student research fund in memory of Georgia Dentel‚  which over 35 of my classmates contributed‚ or pledged over a hundred and $25000 to endow  this student research fund‚ for the future.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:02:02, Which will be‚ led‚ if you will or administered by the history Department of Women and gender  Studies program in the librarian. So the ability to persuade or to end or lead.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:02:24, Leadership skills were generated‚ nurtured at Grinnell. My career has exceeded my wildest  expectations. And‚ you know‚ from a biology major to‚ you know‚ being a legislative director for  a member of Congress from Iowa on Capitol Hill in the 1980s. And working on the energy and  commerce committee‚ and working on the Clean Air Act authorization‚ wasn't in my planning  when I was at Grinnell‚ nor ending up in corporate America for over 27 years to dealing public   policy issues.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:03:17, But‚ Grinnell provided a nurturing and instructive atmosphere to be able to‚ to succeed in life  and to have fun.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:03:50, To learn‚ and to continue to try to help the college and‚ for students and faculty and staff‚ be  successful for the next generation.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  01:04:07, Yeah‚ so‚ and I've been wondering what motivates you to work as the campaign field director for  John Anderson‚ after your graduation straight after your graduation.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:04:40, Well‚ after graduation‚ I was in Boston‚ trying to decide whether I wanted. I had applied to  medical school that didn't get in‚ thank goodness. And I was working at a hospital‚ as a ward  clerk unit secretary for coronary care unit and medical intensive care units. And was trying to  decide whether I wanted to go to law school‚ graduate school or reapply for medical school.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:05:19, And I had a friend from college who was involved more in politics than I was‚ writeto me. We  wrote letters in those days‚ it was sort of like free cell phones. And‚ he was volunteering for the  John Anderson for President campaign in Iowa.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:05:41, And this was in the 1980 primary season. And‚ I wrote him back and said‚ Well‚ he's a  Republican‚ and my college classmate wrote back and said‚ no no no‚ check out his positions.  He's‚ he's really‚ he's really sharp or he's really good or he's not what you're expecting. So I  checked it out.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:06:03, And I really didn't like his positions‚ agreed with him and started volunteering. Since I worked at   the hospital from three to eleven‚ I can volunteer from ten until two. And‚ he was for the  republican primary in Massachusetts‚ and he came in second‚ which was‚ we considered a moral  victory. And then he decided to run for as an independent‚ and so we rebrought the campaign  workers together‚ cause you had to do ballot access‚ and we had to‚ you know‚ get certain  number of signatures to get him on the ballot. And I was in the field organization‚ and we got  him on the ballot and then I interviewed‚ and they hired me to be a field organizer.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:06:54, Which meant I had to leave the hospital‚ so I resigned from the hospital. And then they sent me  to Austin‚ Texas on 1 June‚ 1980‚ and said that I had 30 days to get 25000 verified signatures out  of the city of Austin.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:07:14, And‚ you know‚ I'm 20 something and it's Austin‚ Texas and it's June. And so‚ I used sort of the  skill sets from‚ actually from being a forum desk attendant under the direction of Ms. Jenny  Erickson.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:07:35, Look at the problem‚ figure out a plan‚ execute the plan. And so it's sort of like‚ ok‚ 25000  signatures‚ it's hot. So‚ if you were under the age‚ my plan was if you're under the age of 40‚ you  got a clipboard and you go out to swimming pools‚ air conditioned‚ you know‚ movie theaters‚  malls and‚ developed the teams to do that. And if you were over the age of 40‚ you were in an air  conditioned room and you had the micro film with the voter registration number‚ cause not many  people carry around their voter registration card. So you'd go out to the air conditioned places or  the cool or the swimming pool‚ get the signatures.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:08:24, And‚ come back and they would look up the numbers. And at the end of the month‚ we had  30000 verified signatures and they said we're sending you to Kansas City . I was there for about  two weeks and they sent me to Pittsburgh and I was in Pittsburgh‚ you know‚ from the beginning  of August to the campaign. They say you are gonna be the number 2 person in Pittsburgh.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:09:01, Turn out to be one other person in Pittsburgh‚ and I was her assistant. And her‚I mean‚ I was in  charge of valid access. Organization‚ field work‚ fundraising‚ it was just a great experience. And   from that‚ I went to Washington and turned the corner and it said‚ you know‚ congressman Tom  Tauke in Iowa. I was like‚ and went in there and was hired to be a legislative assistant that day.  And then I became the legislative director and the rest is sort of like.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:09:42, Yeah‚ never say NO to when they asked you to do something. They want to drive the member to  the airport. Oh‚ sure‚ that's great. I'll do that.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:09:57, And don't forget what Professor‚ my advisor when he said‚ you know‚ focus on asking the right  questions. You have problems with the right answers. Dr. Fishman was tough.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:10:17, Tough‚ you would always look like a tough old bird. He was a tough old bird‚ but he was wise.  So focus on asking the right questions.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:10:30, That's a long story to an interesting question. Thanks for asking.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  01:10:34, No problem. So‚ since you worked for representative Tom Tauke after graduation‚ how's your  time at Grinnell built a sort of bond between you and the state of Iowa?  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:10:54, Well‚ in my interview with the congressman for the job‚ he asked me‚ he said‚ you're not from  Iowa‚ how can you work for a member of Iowa? And I would‚ I said‚ well‚ I spent four years at  Grinnell.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:11:13, And I said four years at Grinnell was like a lifetime in Iowa. He sort of looked at me like that‚  you know. But‚ I worked for him for ten years‚ and so I spent a lot of time in the congressional  district‚ which was essentially Northeast iowa. It didn't include Grinnell.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:11:33, So that was ten years‚ in the state and‚ you know‚ I love Iowa. Just a wonderful‚ wonderful  place. And‚ I'll be‚ in fact‚ I'll be coming back this Thursday. I'll be riding Ragbrai‚ which is the  register's annual great bike ride across Iowa.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:11:53, So it's in its 51st year. It's a bicycle ride across the state that started in 1972. And you would ride  ride 500 mi from the Missouri to the Mississippi‚ seven days‚ probably about 70 mi a day.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:12:13, And this will be my 16th year in doing it and it's a wonderful way to reconnect with the state‚  and the route changes every year. Last year it came through Grinnell. We overnighted I think in  Tama.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:12:29, But the last stop was Grinnell‚ and‚ you go about 70 mi a day‚ but you don't get on the bike 70  mi and get off. You go about 10 mi-15 mi breakfast‚ small town where do you want to get a fire  department‚ and ten more miles small town‚ the band is selling bananas. Let's get a banana‚ but  ten more miles out.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:12:49, It's time for a piece of pie‚ you know‚ homemade pie. It's a great experience for I don't know‚  17000 20000 bike riders‚ and so you can eat pie three or four times a day‚ and it's all homemade.  It's not from Hy-Vee and it's a wonderful way to see the state and to meet people.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:13:09, I hand out my mother's pie recipe when I ride across the state‚ and we'll have a college Jersey  college Jersey Day that‚ you know‚ they'll‚ sometimes there are‚ you know‚ 20 or 25 Grinnellians  that are riding. And we'll be wearing our scarlet and black.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:13:32, Actually I'm gonna be‚ I think‚ I'm gonna go to the bookstore on Friday morning to buy one of  the new Jerseys‚ new cycling Jerseys that the bookstore’s selling. So if you want to grab a cup of   coffee on Friday‚ just let me know.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  01:13:53, Yes‚ definitely I'll let you know. So since you also participated in‚ Mast Chorale of Washington  DC and currently I think at Gay Men's Chorus of Washington DC‚ did Grinnell‚ did Georgia's  Events influence you to do that?  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:14:15, No‚ I can't say George's events did that. I would probably say that my involvement in Chorale  music was more related‚ if you will‚ to my work with the celestial Sacrewood Harp Choir at  Grinnell. That you know I I'm a singer‚ I'm a base‚ and thatI was on the asked to be on the board  of board of the Master Chorale.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:14:47, Afterwards the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC. And so I enjoyed supporting choral arts  and think that it's an important part of our culture and it's a beautiful way to‚ you know‚ spend  time listening to wonderful voices. And at our reunion‚ we had a small group that got together to  resing some of the songs that we sang.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  01:15:11, Yeah‚ that sounds a lot of fun. How would you say about your inter interactions with Jenny  Erickson since you’ve mentioned her before.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:15:25, Ms. Ericsson was my boss‚ when I was a forum desk attendant. The forum was sort of like our  camp with‚ you know‚ our student center. And the forum desk attendant was‚ oh that was the best  job on campus. I mean‚ she was an incredible boss. I think in one interview I said I learned more  from Ms. Ericsson than I did from some of my professors.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:15:57, And I remember more of the lessons that she taught me‚ you know. Don't ask me to‚ you know‚  recite the cranial nerves. But I can tell you that‚ you know‚ before every event‚ you know‚ you  triple check the sound‚ to make sure it was working. You made sure that the mics were‚ you  know‚ were questions and answers were working. You made sure that at the end of the event‚   everything was put back in the Ms. Erickson order‚ the way it was supposed to be. You didn't  leave it for someone else.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:16:35, If you saw something that needed to be fixed‚ fix it. If you saw something that needed to be  cleaned‚ clean it. She was very instrumental in my‚ in my entire career.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:16:54, And I was honored to set up a scholarship in her honor‚ and my classmates and I‚ worked on  establishing the Luther and Jenny Ericsson endowed professorship in the chemistry department. I  think it's important to pay back or give back or show your love and support and appreciation for  the many people that have helped me to become what I am today.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  01:17:26, Gotcha. So to finally wrap up for this interview‚ is there anything that you would like to share  with us‚ for this interview?  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:17:44, I guess the final thing is that‚ you haven't asked why‚ I decided to work on establishing both  your map and my gift to the college in downing funds honoring Georgia Dentel. And I guess in  conclusion I would like to offer three reasons about why I've done what I did‚ to honor Georgia.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:18:22, First is that I love history‚ and that specifically I love the history of Grinnell College‚ and  believe that the college is a very‚ very rich history‚ which should be shared. And secondly‚  Georgia Dentel was a key administrator during my years at Grinnell and had a very‚ very  distinguished career as an administrator at the college.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:18:57, You know‚ we've talked about the various artists that she brought in and just the listing of those  artists is just going to be an incredible remembrance of the influence that she had on the campus  and on the students there.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:19:17, And third‚ I think that her work and her history with the college should be recorded and should  be honored. And I'm glad that you and your colleague Maya are working on to establish the base  of the scholarship of her career and the impact that she had on her college. So I appreciate you’re  working on a project which we look forward to reading or seeing or learning about the results.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:19:57, While I didn't ever meet Georgia Dentel‚ I knew who she was and the impact of her. And I think  that she would be excited‚ that you're doing a MAP. She'd be humbled. And I think that she  would be delighted that my classmates have decided to endow student research.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:20:34, A student research fund in her memory because I think that she would probably agree that  student research skills are important for future success. Secondly‚ that developing a relationship  with the professor or professors are key for success in the future and key for an enjoyable college  experience at Grinnell. I still keep in touch with some of my professors.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:21:05, And third‚ I think that she would be pleased that the alumni support the college and looking  back at various parts of her career in the college’s history. So thank you.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  01:21:24, Thank you very much for both participating in this interview and for founding this project. It has  been an utmost honor to interview you and be a member of this.  
,Ed Senn '79,  01:21:44, That's great research opportunity. Thank you so much.  
,Bowen Wei '25,  01:21:48, Thank you. Yep‚ would you like to have a.
